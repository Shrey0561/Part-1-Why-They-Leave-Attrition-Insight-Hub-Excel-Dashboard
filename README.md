# The Exit Equation: Understanding Attrition with Excel
This project is Part 1 of a two-part HR analytics series. While Part 2 - *The Loyalty Blueprint* focuses on employee retention, this analysis uncovers *why employees leave*. Using Excel for both data analysis and dashboard visualization, this project explores the key risk factors and segments most vulnerable to attrition.
Stay tuned for [*The Loyalty Blueprint*](#https://github.com/Shrey0561/Part-2-Why-They-Stay-Retention-Insight-Hub-SQL-Excel-) - The next chapter in decoding employee retention.

## Overview
Using mock HR data with 1470 employee records, this dashboard breaks down turnover by department, role, demographic factors, and satisfaction metrics to pinpoint where the churn is coming from and why it matters.

## Key Questions Answered
 - Which departments and roles see the most attrition?
 - Are there gender or overtime-related turnover patterns?
 - How does income, experience, or satisfaction influence exits?
 - Which employee segments are most at risk of leaving?

## Insights Summary

### Departmental Trends
 - *Sales* had the highest attrition at *20.63%*, followed by *HR* at *19.05%*.
 - These roles may face burnout, limited growth, or unclear KPIs, all potential flight risks.

### Role-Specific Breakdown
 - *Sales Representatives* had an attrition rate of 39.76% nearly 4x the average.
 - In contrast, *Research Directors* had only *2.5%* attrition, pointing to the stability of senior positions.

### Gender Differences
 - *Male Employees:* 17.01% attrition
 - *Female Employees:* 14.80% attrition
 - While the gap is narrow, it may reflect different role distributions or career drivers.

### Overtime & Burnout
 - *30.53* of employees who worked *overtime* eventually left.
 - Even without overtime, *10.44% attrition* still occurred, suggesting that burnout isn't the only factor; culture, leadership, and career stagnation may also play a role.

### Income & Retention
 - Employees in the *low-income* band had a 28.61% attrition
 - This reinforces the link between compensation and retention, especially in frontline roles.

### Experience Matters
 - *Fresh hires (0-1 years)*: 34.88% attrition
 - *Experienced Employees (5+ years)*: 12.91% attrition
 - A significant gap, highlighting the need for stronger onboarding and early-stage engagement.

### Satisfaction Metrics
 - *Work-Life Balance (Rating 1)*: 31.25% attrition
 - *Job Satisfaction (Rating 1)*: 22.84% attrition
 - Even those with high satisfaction ratings (4/5) were leaving, reminding us that engagement is multi-dimensional.

## What I'd Explore Next
If this were a real consulting engagement:
 - Add *exit interview data* to capture qualitative reasons for leaving
 - Analyze *time-based patterns* in attrition (e.g., seasonality, post-promotion exits)
 - Integrate *employee engagement surveys* to enrich predictive signals
